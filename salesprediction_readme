# Sales Prediction using Python

## Description

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict sales based on historical data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps to help businesses forecast future sales and make informed decisions.

## Overview

### Data Preprocessing
The historical sales data is preprocessed to create a clean and structured dataset. This involves handling missing values, feature scaling, and creating relevant features from the raw data.

### Model Architecture
A machine learning model is built using Scikit-learn. The model includes algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or other suitable regression techniques to predict sales based on input features.

### Training
The model is trained using the preprocessed data, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance.

### Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. The evaluation helps in understanding the model's accuracy and reliability.

### Prediction
The final model is used to make sales predictions on new, unseen data. Predictions are compared against actual sales to validate the model's effectiveness.

## Files Included

- `salesprediction-checkpoint.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `data/advertising.csv`: Historical sales data used for training and testing the model. This dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset).
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies and packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
